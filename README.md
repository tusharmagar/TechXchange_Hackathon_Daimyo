# 🏆 Daimyo: Revolutionizing Restaurant Efficiency with WatsonX AI

Welcome to **Daimyo**, a comprehensive SaaS platform powered by WatsonX AI's Granite models, designed to help restaurants save time and optimize their operations. Built with accessibility and scalability in mind, Daimyo is already saving restaurants 7-9 hours weekly, even in its current proof-of-concept stage.

This project was developed as part of the **WatsonX Hackathon**, and we believe Daimyo has the potential to redefine business intelligence for small to medium-scale restaurants.

## 🚀 Features

Daimyo connects seamlessly to the wealth of data available to restaurants—from customer reviews to point-of-sale data and reservations—enabling them to interact with their data in powerful ways. For this hackathon, we’ve built **four comprehensive modules** to demonstrate the platform’s capabilities.

### 1. **Custom Reviews Alerts**
- **Never miss important feedback**: Daimyo can be customized to send real-time alerts for poor or exceptionally good reviews.
- **Granite-powered suggested replies**: Respond to reviews quickly and appropriately with AI-generated suggestions.
- **Future Potential**: Expand alerts to cover special customer events like birthdays or low inventory warnings.
  
> ⏳ **Save hours** by automating feedback responses and important alerts.

### 2. **Automated Reports**
- **Set-and-forget reporting**: Choose a modifiable template, set the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), and Daimyo will generate and send reports automatically.
- **Granite-powered sentiment analysis**: Identify positive or negative trends in your data to stay ahead of potential issues.
- **Flexible report types**: Customize reports on sales, reservations, or inventory based on your needs.

> 📊 **Gain valuable insights** with fully automated, customizable reports.

### 3. **SQL Chat**
- **Natural language queries**: Ask questions like “What are my best sellers?” and get answers in seconds, all without needing SQL expertise.
- **Granite-powered processing**: Provides actionable insights and generates shareable tables.

> 💡 **Fast insights** at your fingertips, perfect for business owners on the go.

### 4. **RAG Chat & Dashboard**
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Query non-SQL data such as customer reviews. Ask questions like “How is the ambience?” and get feedback with referenced reviews.
- **Future-Proof Dashboard Integration**: Imagine a world where Daimyo is integrated directly into your POS system, turning raw data into powerful interactive visuals.

> 📈 **Interactive analytics** that go beyond standard reports, giving you a complete understanding of your restaurant's performance.
