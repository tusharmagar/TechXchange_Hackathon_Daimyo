## ❓ What is Daimyo?

Welcome to **Daimyo**, a comprehensive SaaS platform powered by **WatsonX AI's Granite models**, designed to help restaurants save time and optimize their operations. Built with accessibility and scalability in mind, Daimyo is already making a significant impact, streamlining restaurant operations and enhancing efficiency even in its current proof-of-concept stage.

This project was developed as part of the **WatsonX Hackathon**, and we believe Daimyo has the potential to redefine business intelligence for small to medium-scale restaurants.

## 🎯 Why Daimyo?

We built Daimyo with one clear goal: **to empower restaurants to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently**, no matter their scale. Whether it’s automating reports, generating actionable insights, or leveraging cutting-edge AI to respond to customer feedback, Daimyo does it all.

## 🚀 Features

Daimyo connects seamlessly to the wealth of data available to restaurants—from customer reviews to point-of-sale data and reservations—enabling them to interact with their data in powerful ways. For this hackathon, we’ve built **four comprehensive modules** to demonstrate the platform’s capabilities.

### 1. **Custom Reviews Alerts**
- **Never miss important feedback**: Daimyo can be customized to send real-time alerts for poor or exceptionally good reviews.
- **Granite-powered suggested replies**: Respond to reviews quickly and appropriately with AI-generated suggestions.
- **Future Potential**: Expand alerts to cover special customer events like birthdays or low inventory warnings.
  
> ⏳ **Save hours** by automating feedback responses and important alerts.

### 2. **Automated Reports**
- **Set-and-forget reporting**: Choose a modifiable template, set the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), and Daimyo will generate and send reports automatically.
- **Granite-powered sentiment analysis**: Identify positive or negative trends in your data to stay ahead of potential issues.
- **Flexible report types**: Customize reports on sales, reservations, or inventory based on your needs.

> 📊 **Gain valuable insights** with fully automated, customizable reports.

### 3. **SQL Chat**
- **Natural language queries**: Ask questions like “What are my best sellers?” and get answers in seconds, all without needing SQL expertise.
- **Granite-powered processing**: Provides actionable insights and generates shareable tables.

> 💡 **Fast insights** at your fingertips, perfect for business owners on the go.

### 4. **RAG Chat & Dashboard**
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Query non-SQL data such as customer reviews. Ask questions like “How is the ambience?” and get feedback with referenced reviews.
- **Future-Proof Dashboard Integration**: Imagine a world where Daimyo is integrated directly into your POS system, turning raw data into powerful interactive visuals.

> 📈 **Interactive analytics** that go beyond standard reports, giving you a complete understanding of your restaurant's performance.
